# Hi there, I'm Poorvi!

As a Computer Science Engineering student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics**, Iâ€™m passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.  
I focus on **end-to-end development** â€” from data collection and preprocessing to model building, explainability, and deployment.  

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **real-time acoustic signal classification** as an AI/ML Intern at *SciHawk Secure Tech*.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continuously learning about **time-series forecasting, deep learning architectures, and model deployment strategies**.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Machine Learning, NLP, Data Analytics, Time-Series Forecasting, Churn Prediction, or Sentiment Analysis**.
